              Hello! My name is ZoÃ« Rorvig. I graduated from UNC Asheville/NC State with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering,
              concentrated in Mechatronics, with a minor in Mathematics. Since I graduated, I've worked at Continental as a Quality
              Systems Engineer. During my time there, I used several programs to create internal websites and paperless document systems.
              Now, I'm looking at getting back into something a little more technical. I've enjoyed learning some of the "behind-the-scenes"
              aspects of the programs/websites I used while at Continental and look forward to learning more.
            </p>
