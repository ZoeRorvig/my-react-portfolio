      Hello! My name is ZoÃ« Rorvig. I graduated from UNC Asheville/NC State with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering, concentrated in Mechatronics, with a minor in Mathematics. Since I graduated, I've worked at Continental as a Quality Systems Engineer. During my time there, I used several programs to create internal websites and paperless document systems. Now, I'm looking at getting back into something a little more technical. I've enjoyed learning some of the "behind-the-scenes" aspects of the programs/websites I used while at Continental and look forward to learning more.
